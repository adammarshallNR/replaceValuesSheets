# Google Sheets Replace Values function
Quick apps script to replace values in a range based on existing value

I had a use case where I needed to send a customersome data from an internal tool.\
There were some values the customer didn't need to see, but they did need to know if they were 0 or greater than zero (the values weren't sensitive per se, but they would have required a lengthy explanation thatwouldn't have added value for the customer).  

TODO:\
Add menu\
Add range picker\
Add threshold picker\
